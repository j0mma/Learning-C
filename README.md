# Learning-C
A simple approch to learn how to program in C and go from a beginner level to an advanced level.  

#### **Section 1: Introduction**
* **`Number system`**:
  * Understand Binary, Decimal & Hexadecimal number system.
  * Understand how to represent `integer`, `negative` and `floating point` numbers in those bases.
  * Understand how to do the `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication` and `division` operations in those bases. 
* **`Source code`**: Understand the syntax rules for formating source code. 
* **`Compilation`**: Understand how source code is transformed into an executable file. 
* **`Command line vs IDE`**: Understand how to compile (Build) and run your program with an IDE and the command line.
#### **Section 2: Data types, Operators and Expressions** 
* **`Data types`**: 
  * Understand how different data types (numbers, characters) are represented in C.
  * Understand the sizes of each data type representation.
  * Understand how to declare and initialize variables or constants.
* **`Operators`**: Understand how operators (arithmetic, relational and logical, bitwise) works in C.
* **`Expressions`**: Understand how different expressions are evaluated in C. 
#### **Section 3: Control Flow** 
* **`Conditionals`**: Understand the `If-Else`, `Else-If` and `Switch` conditional structures.
* **`Loops`**: Understand the `while`, `for` and `do-while` loop structures. 
* **`Control statements`**: Understand when and how to use those statements
  * `Break` and `Continue`
  * `Goto` and `Label` 
#### **Section 4: Functions, Program structure and The Preprocessor**
* **`Functions`**: Understand what is a function and how to use it. Also understand how and when to use the `return` statement. 
* **`Program structure`**: 
  * Understand how to write program with multiple source code files.
  * Understand variables scope and when to use the keywords `static` and `extern` for variables.
  * Understand functions scope and when to use the keywords `static` and `extern` for functions.
* **`Preprocessor`**:
  * Understand macros with the `#define` statement and `inline` functions.
  * Understand program extendability, portability, the `#` and the `##` operators.
  * Understand conditional compilation to master when to use:
    * The `#ifdef`, `#endif`, `#else`, `#ifndef` statements.
    * The `#if` and `#elif` statements.
    * The `#undef` statements. 
#### **Section 5: Pointers, Arrays and Character strings** 
#### **Section 6: Structures and Extended Data Types** 
#### **Section 7: Input and Output operations** 
#### **Section 8: Debugging programs** 
#### **Section 9: UNIX**
