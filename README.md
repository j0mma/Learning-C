# Learn to program with C
A simple approch to learn how to program in C and go from a beginner level to an advanced level.  

#### **Section 1: Introduction**
* **`Number system`**:
  * Understand Binary, Decimal & Hexadecimal number system.
  * Understand how to represent `integer`, `negative` and `floating point` numbers in these number system.
  * Understand how to do the `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication` and `division` operations in these number system. 
* **`Source code`**: Understand the syntax rules for formating source code. 
* **`Compilation`**: Understand how source code is transformed into an executable file. 
* **`Command line vs IDE`**: Understand how to compile (Build) and run your program with an IDE and the command line.
#### **Section 2: Data types, Operators and Expressions** 
* **`Data types`**: 
  * Understand how different data types (numbers, characters) are represented in C.
  * Understand the sizes of each data type representation.
  * Understand how to declare and initialize variables or constants.
* **`Operators`**: Understand how operators (arithmetic, relational and logical, bitwise) works in C.
* **`Expressions`**: Understand how different expressions are evaluated in C. 
#### **Section 3: Control Flow** 
* **`Conditionals`**: Understand the `If-Else`, `Else-If` and `Switch` conditional structures.
* **`Loops`**: Understand the `while`, `for` and `do-while` loop structures. 
* **`Control statements`**: Understand when and how to use those statements
  * `Break` and `Continue`
  * `Goto` and `Label` 
#### **Section 4: Arrays**
* **`Arrays`**: Understand what are arrays and how they work.
* **`Character arrays`**: Understand the particularity with character arrays.
* **`Multi dimensional arrays`**: Understand the use and the meaning of multi dimensional arrays.
#### **Section 5: Functions**
* **`Functions`**: 
  * Understand what is a function, how and when to use it.  
  * Understand the difference between arguments called by `value` and by `reference` 
  * Understand the difference between and `local` variables.
#### **Section 6: Pointers and Memory**
* **`Pointers`**:
  * Understand `pointers` and `adresses`.
  * Understand how and when to use pointers for variables and functions.
* **`Memory`**:
  * Understand the program memory layout
  * Understand how and where all the data (variables, constants, functions, etc...) related to a program is stored.  
  * Understand dynamic memory allocation.
#### **Section 7: Structures and Extended Data Types** 
  * **`Structures`**:
    * Understand the basics of Structures.
    * Understand the relation between structures and functions.
    * Understand arrays of structures, structures containing arrays, pointers to structures and structure containing pointers. 
  * **`Unions`**: Understand what are `unions`, how and when they are used.
  * **`Bit-fields`**: Understand what are `bit-fields`, how and when they are used. 
#### **Section 8: Input and Output operations** 
#### **Section 9: Multi file program structure** 
* **`Program structure`**: 
  * Understand how to write and compile programs with multiple source files.
  * Understand variables scope between modules (source files).
  * Understand functions scope between modules (source files).
* **`Preprocessor`**:
  * Understand macros with the `#define` statement and `inline` functions.
  * Understand program extendability, portability, the `#` and the `##` operators.
  * Understand conditional compilation to master when to use:
    * The `#ifdef`, `#endif`, `#else`, `#ifndef` statements.
    * The `#if` and `#elif` statements.
    * The `#undef` statements.
#### **Section 10: Debugging programs** 
* **`Debugging with an IDE`**: Understand how to debug program with IDE tools.
* **`Debugging with GDB`**: Understand how to use the GNU debugger.
#### **Section 9: UNIX**
