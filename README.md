#### **Section 1: The Basics**
* **`Number system`**:
  * Understand Binary, Decimal & Hexadecimal number system.
  * Understand how to represent `integer`, `negative` and `floating point` numbers in those bases.
  * Understand how to do the 4 basic operations (addition , subtraction, multiplication and division) in those bases. 
* **`Source code`**: Understand the syntax rules for formating source code. 
* **`Compilation`**: Understand how source code is transformed into an executable file. 
* **`Command line vs IDE`**: Understand how to compile (Build) and run your program with an IDE and the command line.
#### **Section 2: Data types, Operators and Expressions** 
* **`Data types`**: 
  * Understand how different data types (numbers, characters) are represented in C.
  * Understand the sizes of each data type representation.
  * Understand how to declare and initialize variables or constants.
* **`Operators`**: Understand how operators (arithmetic, relational and logical, bitwise) works in C.
* **`Expressions`**: Understand how different expressions are evaluated in C.
